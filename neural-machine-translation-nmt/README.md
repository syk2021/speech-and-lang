# Neural Machine Translation (NMT) 
Machine Translation has evolved from statistical machine translation to neural machine translation.
This repo deals with text-based translation, so I also include statistical machine translation papers.
Also referenced papers from Professor Cohan's Spring 2024 NLP Course at Yale: https://yale-nlp.github.io/cpsc477/schedule/.
